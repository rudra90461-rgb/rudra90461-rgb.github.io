    <p><strong>Last Updated: January 24, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled in 
        <strong>Business War 2026</strong> (the "App"). 
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a transparent gaming experience.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information 
        (such as name, phone number, email address, or address) on our own servers.
        The App is designed to function locally on your device (Offline-First).
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Game Progress Data</h3>
    <p>
        Game progress data (such as in-game currency, business levels, inventory, and statistics)
        is stored locally on your device using strictly local storage mechanisms. This data never leaves your device
        and is not accessible by the developer.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Advertising Data</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements.
        AdMob may collect and process the following data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads:

        <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>By using this App, you consent to the collection and use of data by Google AdMob
        in accordance with their privacy policies.</strong> Users can manage or reset their
        advertising identifiers through their device settings.
