    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: February 6, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how information is handled in 
        <strong>Brain Logic War: Math & Puzzles</strong> (the "App"). 
        We are committed to providing a safe, educational, and fun brain-training experience.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information 
        (such as name, phone number, email address, or address) on our own servers. 
        The App is designed to function locally on your device (Offline-First).
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Game Progress Data</h3>
    <p>
        All game progress is stored locally on your device using strictly local storage mechanisms. This data never leaves your device and includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Math Quiz:</strong> High scores, current level, and lives remaining.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Discovery:</strong> Vocabulary progress, levels unlocked, and hint usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Sudoku:</strong> Current puzzle state, difficulty selection, and completion times.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Math:</strong> High scores and level progression.</li>
        <li><strong>Logic Puzzles:</strong> Puzzle completion status (3x3 to 6x6 grids) and best times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Advertising Data</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements (including Interstitial and Rewarded Video ads) to keep the app free to use. 
        AdMob may collect and process the following data to serve ads:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (such as Android Advertising ID).</li>
        <li>Approximate location information (network-based).</li>
        <li>Ad interaction and usage data (e.g., ad impressions, clicks, reward verification).</li>
        <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>By using this App, you consent to the collection and use of data by Google AdMob 
        in accordance with their privacy policies.</strong> Users can manage or reset their 
        advertising identifiers through their Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify your device for advertising and analytics purposes. 
        Please review their privacy policies for more details:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">
                Google Play Services Privacy Policy
            </a>

                Google AdMob Privacy Policy
            </a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. 
        While the content of this application is suitable for all ages (Brain Training & Education), 
        the ad integration is intended for general audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, 
        please contact us so that we can take necessary actions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Since no user data is stored on external developer servers, you retain full control over your data. 
        You can delete all game progress and data at any time by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clearing the App’s "Storage" and "Cache" from your Android Settings.</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the App from your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our game features. 
        Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. 
        You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
    </p>
